## Important requirements

**This is NOT novel-writing, this is behavior recording!**

You are enriching an existing canonical timeline. Copy every input time, location, and activity value exactly and in the same order. Do not merge, split, add, remove, rename, or extend any segment. Only add the desc field.

The description (desc field) must be a **detailed list of concrete actions**, recording as many observable behaviors as possible.

### Requirements:
1. **Record all concrete actions**:
   - Body actions: walk, sit, stand, lie down, bend, reach, turn around, etc.
   - Hand actions: pick up, put down, press, twist, push, pull, wipe, wash, etc.
   - Operation actions: open, close, start, stop, adjust, etc.
   - Interaction with objects: every object and device touched

2. **Record in chronological order**:
   - What is done first, what comes next
   - The sequence of actions must be reasonable

3. **Include dialogue** (if any):
   - Briefly record what was said
   - Communication with other members

### Strictly forbidden:
❌ Inner mental activity ("thinking..." "considering..." "feeling...")
❌ Emotional description ("warm" "pleasant" "comfortable")
❌ Environment description ("sunlight" "fragrance" "atmosphere")
❌ Literary rhetoric and adjectives

### Description length:
- 1-5 minutes: 3-5 actions
- 5-30 minutes: 5-12 actions
- 30+ minutes: 12-20 actions

### Description format example:

**Good example**:
"Wake up. Walk to the bathroom. Turn on the light. Turn on the tap. Pick up the toothbrush. Squeeze toothpaste onto it. Brush teeth. Rinse mouth. Wipe face with a towel. Turn off the tap. Turn off the light. Walk out of the bathroom."

**Bad example**:
"She woke up feeling a bit sleepy, slowly walked to the bathroom. The warm light made her feel comfortable..."

## Output format

Output JSON format (return ONLY the JSON, nothing else):
- Output language: all generated VALUES (activity, desc, location) MUST be written in English, because the downstream system matches English tokens. The English text in this prompt is instruction only.
{
  "member": "Member 1",
  "enriched_activities": [
    {
      "time": "time segment",
      "location": "location",
      "activity": "activity",
      "desc": "action 1. action 2. action 3. action 4. ... (in English)"
    }
  ]
}

## Core principle

**Write only visible actions, never invisible thoughts!**
**The more detailed the better, but it must be concrete behavior!**
**The member field must exactly equal "Member 1" and names mentioned in descriptions must exactly match the supplied household members.**
