You are a household life coordination expert. Coordinate Member 1's timeline against locked earlier timelines and provisional later timelines.

## Member information
- Name: Member 1
- Age: 24
- Occupation: Master of Social Work student at Monash University; part-time aged-care support worker
- Personality: communal, organised, consensus-seeking, loyal, cautious about risk and money, late adopter of technology, detail-oriented

## Locked earlier-member timelines
These members are already coordinated and must not be treated as adjustable: None

None

## Provisional later-member timelines
These members have only macro plans. Use them to anticipate conflicts, but they will be coordinated later: None

None

## Current member's original timeline

Member 1's original timeline:
  00:00-06:30: Bedroom 1 - Sleeping
  06:30-07:00: Bathroom - Washing and getting dressed
  07:00-07:30: Kitchen - Preparing and eating breakfast (flexitarian, tea)
  07:30-08:30: Out - Commuting to Monash University via train and bus
  08:30-09:00: Out - Arriving at campus and preparing for classes
  09:00-13:00: Out - Attending social work classes and seminars
  13:00-14:00: Out - Eating packed lunch and reviewing notes
  14:00-17:00: Out - Attending more classes and group study
  17:00-18:00: Out - Commuting to aged-care facility for evening shift
  18:00-22:00: Out - Working as aged-care support worker (evening shift), including a break to eat a packed flexitarian dinner
  22:00-23:00: Out - Commuting home via public transport
  23:00-23:30: Bathroom - Showering and getting ready for bed
  23:30-24:00: Bedroom 1 - Setting reminders and going to sleep

## Actual household rooms

["Bedroom 1", "Bedroom 2", "Bedroom 3", "Bedroom 4", "Bedroom 5", "Bedroom 6", "Kitchen", "Bathroom"]

Member 1's assigned private bedroom is exactly: Bedroom 1

## Actual exclusive resource constraints

[
  {
    "unique_id": "member_2_electricvehicle",
    "name": "ElectricVehicle",
    "type": "charging",
    "owner": "Member 2",
    "location": null,
    "rules": [
      "Only one person can use it at a time",
      "The user is responsible for taking it out and returning it",
      "Others may choose to ride along",
      "When returning home, only the person who took it out can drive it back, or pick up others on the way"
    ]
  }
]

If the list above is empty, the household has NO electric vehicle or other exclusive appliance. Never invent one.

**Coordination requirements**:
1. Only if an ElectricVehicle is present above, if an already-coordinated member uses it to go out during some period, Member 1 has these options:
   - Ride along (adjust departure and return times to match the user)
   - Use other transport (bus, train, walking, etc.)
   - Adjust the outing time to avoid the conflict

2. If Member 1 needs to use the electric vehicle:
   - Ensure no one else is using it during that period
   - If others need to go out at the same time, consider letting them ride along
   - Explicitly mark "drive the EV", and also mark "drive the EV back" when returning

3. Electric vehicle usage continuity:
   - Whoever drives it out is responsible for driving it back
   - If someone needs to come home mid-way, the driver may drop them off on the way
   - The activity description must reflect details such as "drive" (driving), "ride along" (riding along), "take XX home" (taking XX home)

## Coordination tasks

Adjust Member 1's timeline according to the already-coordinated members' timelines, so that it:

1. **Identify joint activity opportunities**
   - If an already-coordinated member is eating, doing chores, etc. during a period, consider whether Member 1 should join
   - If multiple members' activities can be merged or collaborated on, adjust the times to align them

2. **Resolve spatial conflicts**
   - If Member 1's activity uses the same space at the same time as an already-coordinated member, adjust the time or space
   - Keep core activities (work, sleep, etc.) unchanged as a priority

3. **Coordinate exclusive resource usage**
   - Strictly follow the usage rules of exclusive resources such as the electric vehicle
   - Explicitly mark the resource usage mode in activity descriptions (drive/ride along)
   - Ensure the continuity and reasonableness of resource usage

4. **Optimize household collaboration**
   - Identify duplicate activities that could be done by one person
   - Allocate chores and caregiving responsibilities reasonably
   - Consider interaction and companionship between household members

5. **Maintain reasonableness**
   - The adjusted timeline must fit Member 1's identity and habits
   - Keep the logical continuity of activities
   - Ensure sufficient rest and personal time

## Output format

Output the adjusted complete timeline in JSON format (return ONLY the JSON, nothing else):

{
  "member": "Member 1",
  "coordinated_activities": [
    {
      "time": "time segment (e.g., 07:00-07:30)",
      "location": "location",
      "activity": "activity description (if involving the EV, explicitly mark: drive the EV to XX / ride along with XX in the EV to XX / drive the EV back)"
    }
  ]
}

## Requirements

- Output language: all generated VALUES (location, activity descriptions) MUST be written in English, because the downstream system matches English tokens. The English text in this prompt is instruction only. EV usage markers are the English tokens drive/ride along/drive the EV back (see below).
- Output the complete day timeline (00:00-24:00)
- Start exactly at 00:00 and end exactly at 24:00. Adjacent segments must touch with no missing minute.
- Time segments must not overlap
- Time segments must be continuous, with no gaps
- Activity descriptions must be clear and specific
- If there are joint activities with other members, reflect them in the description (e.g., "having breakfast with XX")
- **If the electric vehicle is involved, the usage mode must be explicitly marked** (drive/ride along)
- **Ensure electric vehicle usage continuity** (whoever drives it out drives it back)
- Activity descriptions must be in English
- Output must be valid JSON
- Every home location must exactly match one of the actual room names above; outside activity uses exactly Out.
- The member may use common rooms and only their assigned private bedroom. Never place them in another resident's bedroom.
- Never change this member's identity, occupation, or core work/study role.
- A single Bathroom is exclusive for private washing/showering/toilet routines; do not overlap those uses with another member.
