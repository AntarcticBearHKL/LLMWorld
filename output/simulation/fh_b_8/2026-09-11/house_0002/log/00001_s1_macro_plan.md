Time information:
Date: 2026-09-11 (Friday) (Workday)









Typical schedule anchors (Australian population time-use baseline, empirically anchored from Xia et al. 2026):
- Weekdays: 6:30-7:30 wake up & wash; 7:00-8:00 breakfast; 8:00-9:00 commute;
  9:00-17:00 work/school; 17:00-18:00 return home; 18:00-19:00 dinner;
  22:30-23:30 go to bed
- Weekends: 7:30-9:00 wake up; morning chores/shopping/socializing; midday meal out or at home;
  afternoon leisure/sports; 19:00-20:00 dinner; 23:00-24:00 go to bed
- Adjust reasonably by occupation (office worker/student/homemaker/shift worker), age, and family role;
  individual variation is allowed, but the main schedule peaks (wake/meals/bedtime) should align with the anchors;
  families with young children should move naptime and bedtime earlier

Generate this member's activities from 00:00 to 24:00 for the full day. Requirements:
- Each time segment must include: time, location, activity description
- The `time` value MUST be the range form HH:MM-HH:MM (zero-padded 24-hour clock), for example "06:50-07:00". A single timestamp such as "06:50" is INVALID. Use only the hyphen "-" as the separator (no en dashes, no spaces, no other characters).
- Time values must span 00:00 to 24:00: the first segment starts at 00:00 and the last segment ends at 24:00.
- Location requirements:
  - If at home, must specify the actual room name, and the room must be a real room that exists in the household structure
  - If out, write the English value Out (out)
- Output language: all generated VALUES (location room names, activity descriptions) MUST be written in English, because the downstream system matches English tokens. The English text in this prompt is instruction only.
- Activity description requirements:
  - Describe only what this member is doing
  - Do not include interactions with other household members
  - If at home, describe specific personal activities (e.g., watching TV, cooking, sleeping, washing)
  - If out, describe what they are doing outside (e.g., working, meeting, shopping)
- Time segment granularity is 1 minute
- If consecutive time segments are at the same location doing the same thing, they must be merged into one segment
- Consistent with the role's traits and daily routine
- If carry-over context is given, the day must start exactly where the previous day ended; never teleport home from work.
- Must start at 00:00 and cover the complete 24 hours
- Adjacent segments must touch exactly: the end of one segment is the start of the next. The last segment must end at 24:00, not 23:59.
- The member field must exactly equal "Member 2".
- Never change the member's identity or occupation. Work/study activities must match the stated occupation and the workday/weekend context.
- At home, this member may use common rooms and only the bedroom assigned to them in Household members. Never place them in another resident's bedroom.
- Do not mention or use any vehicle or household resource unless it appears in the supplied household structure.

Output JSON format (return ONLY the JSON, nothing else):
{
  "member": "Member 2",
  "activities": [
    {"time": "00:00-06:30", "location": "...", "activity": "..."},
    {"time": "06:30-07:00", "location": "...", "activity": "..."},
    {"time": "07:00-07:30", "location": "...", "activity": "..."}
  ]
}
