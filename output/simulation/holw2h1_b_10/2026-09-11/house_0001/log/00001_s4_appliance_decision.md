## Appliance type explanation

### 1. on_demand (use-on-demand appliances)
- Description: devices that only consume power when used (e.g., desk lamp, TV, A/C)
- Available actions:
  - "use": use the device (consumes power)
  - "idle": do not use the device (no power consumption)

### 2. charging (charging devices)
- Description: charging devices (e.g., phone, electric vehicle)
- Available actions:
  - "charge_home": charge using household electricity (counts toward household usage)
  - "charge_external": charge using external electricity (does not count toward household usage)
  - "use": use the device (consumes previously charged power, no new consumption)
  - "idle": neither use nor charge
- Charge the EV/E-bike only until its battery is full, then set it to "idle". A device can absorb at most one full battery per day, so never charge beyond its remaining capacity. Prefer overnight/off-peak hours for EV and E-bike charging.

### 3. always_on (continuously consuming devices)
- Description: devices that consume power continuously (e.g., refrigerator)
- Available actions: none (auto-runs, no decision needed)

### 4. cycle (fixed-energy-per-run appliances)
- Description: multi-phase appliances that complete a fixed program per run (e.g., washing machine, clothes dryer, dishwasher, oven, rice cooker)
- Available actions:
  - "run": start one full cycle (costs the appliance's fixed cycle energy; do not model the cost as power x time)
  - "idle": do not run (no cycle energy consumed)
- A full run costs the full cycle energy; a partial run costs proportionally.

## Decision principles

1. **Decide based on activity content**: decide which appliances are needed based on the member's activity and room
2. **Only use available actions**: each appliance can only use the actions listed in its available_actions
3. **always_on devices need no decision**: continuously consuming devices like refrigerators auto-run; do not include them in the output
4. **Consider environmental factors**: season, weather, and temperature affect electricity demand (e.g., A/C in summer)
5. **Match lifestyle habits**: decide according to the member's habit traits
6. **Be mindful of energy saving**: set appliances in a room to idle when leaving it
7. **Appliance use when out**:
   - When the location is "Out", ONLY this member's personal portable appliances may be operated (e.g. Phone, Laptop, Computer, DeskLamp).
   - Room appliances (lights, TV, A/C, kitchen appliances, water heater, washing machine, etc.) MUST NOT be operated while Out.
   - While Out, `charge_home` is FORBIDDEN; only `charge_external`, `use`, and `idle` are valid for personal appliances.
    - The downstream validator drops every room appliance operation and every `charge_home` issued while Out.
8. **Use standby_watts for idle draw**: an appliance left idle/standby still draws its `standby_watts`; do not assume idle means zero consumption.
9. **Respect duty_cycle**: appliances with `duty_cycle` below 1 (e.g. thermostatic loads such as A/C) cycle on and off; never assume 100% duty when deciding runtime.
10. **Respect season**: match `season` against the environment: `heating` appliances matter in cold weather, `cooling` appliances in hot weather.
11. **Prefer off-peak for flexible loads**: when a peak/policy context is given, shift appliances marked `flexible: true` away from the configured peak periods.

## Typical usage durations (must follow, keep realistic)

| Appliance | Typical single-use duration | Daily cumulative cap |
|---|---|---|
| EV charging | Charge 2-4 hours at night to full, **stop when full** (one full battery per day max); recommended after 22:00 | 4 hours |
| E-bike charging | Charge 1-3 hours overnight, **stop when full** (one full battery per day max) | 0.7 kWh |
| Water heater | 15-30 minutes per shower | 45 minutes |
| A/C | Can turn off after 1-3 hours (comfortable temperature reached) | 6 hours |
| Space heater | 1-3 hours per session | 6 hours |
| Fan | 1-8 hours during daytime/heat | 8 hours |
| Dehumidifier | 1-3 hours per session | 8 hours |
| Washing machine | 1 cycle (1-1.5 hours per load) | 1-2 loads per day |
| Clothes dryer | 1 cycle (1.5-2 hours per load) | 1 load per day |
| Dishwasher | 1 cycle (1.5-2 hours) | 1-2 loads per day; prefer off-peak/after 21:00 |
| Induction cooker/rice cooker | 30-60 minutes for cooking | 2 hours |
| Oven | 30-90 minutes per use | 2 hours |
| Microwave | 3-10 minutes to heat | 1 hour |
| Kettle | 2-6 minutes per boil | as needed |
| Toaster | 2-5 minutes per use | as needed |
| TV | 1-3 hours of watching | 8 hours |
| Computer | used during work hours | 10 hours |
| Monitor | on only while the computer is in use | same as computer |
| Game console | 1-3 hours per session | as needed |
| Phone charging | 1-2 hours to full | 4 hours |
| Lamp/desk lamp | on whenever someone is in the room | 16 hours |
| Vacuum cleaner | 15-30 minutes per cleaning | 1 hour |
| Range hood | on while cooking | 2 hours |
| Freezer/Router | always_on - auto-runs, no decision | n/a |

**Important**: do not run high-power appliances (A/C/EV/water heater) continuously for long periods. For example, the EV may charge at most 4 hours per day and should be set to idle once full; never charge more than one full battery per day.
If a canonical activity segment is longer than an appliance's allowed runtime, still include the semantically necessary operation. The downstream energy calculator will clip its actual powered minutes to the daily cap; never omit a required appliance solely because the timeline segment cannot be split.

## Typical usage periods (Australian schedule baseline, Xia et al. 2026)

| Period | Typical appliance activity |
|---|---|
| 6:30-8:00 wake/breakfast | rice cooker/microwave/induction cooker (breakfast), lamps |
| 8:00-17:00 work hours | computer (when working from home), standby |
| 17:00-19:00 return/dinner | induction cooker/range hood/rice cooker (dinner), water heater (shower) |
| 19:00-22:30 evening leisure | TV/computer/lamps, washing machine/vacuum (as needed) |
| 22:30-07:00 night | EV charging (starting after 22:00, 2-4 hours), phone charging |

- A/C: hot summer periods (12:00-21:00 as needed), turn off once comfortable
- Washing machine/vacuum: weekday evenings or weekend daytime (do not run late at night, noise)
- The above are typical periods and must be consistent with the member's timeline activities; reasonable deviations are allowed

## Allowed unique_id list (copy exactly, nothing else is valid)

Every operation's `unique_id` MUST be copied character-for-character from the list below. Do NOT invent, shorten, translate, or paraphrase an id. Any id that is not in this list is invalid and will be discarded by the downstream validator.

- bedroom_1_fan
- bedroom_1_light
- bedroom_2_fan
- bedroom_2_light
- bedroom_3_fan
- bedroom_3_light
- bedroom_4_fan
- bedroom_4_light
- bedroom_5_fan
- bedroom_5_light
- kitchen_microwave
- kitchen_ricecooker
- kitchen_inductioncooker
- kitchen_rangehood
- kitchen_kettle
- kitchen_toaster
- kitchen_oven
- kitchen_light
- bathroom_waterheater
- bathroom_washingmachine
- bathroom_light
- living_room_tv
- living_room_gameconsole
- living_room_airconditioner
- member_1_computer
- member_1_phone
- member_1_desklamp
- member_2_computer
- member_2_phone
- member_2_desklamp
- member_3_computer
- member_3_phone
- member_3_desklamp
- member_4_computer
- member_4_phone
- member_4_desklamp
- member_5_computer
- member_5_phone
- member_5_desklamp

Always-on appliances (do NOT create operations for these):
- kitchen_refrigerator
- living_room_router

## Output format

Output JSON format (return ONLY the JSON, nothing else):
- Output language: all generated VALUES (location room names, activity descriptions) MUST be written in English, because the downstream system matches English tokens. The English text in this prompt is instruction only.
{
  "member": "Member 1",
  "appliance_decisions": [
    {
      "time": "time segment (e.g., 08:00-09:00)",
      "location": "room name",
      "activity": "activity description",
      "operations": [
        {
          "unique_id": "appliance unique ID",
          "action": "action (must be one of the appliance's available_actions)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

## Important constraints

1. **Must use unique_id**: do not use appliance names. Copy a unique_id character-for-character from the supplied household structure; never construct, shorten, or guess an ID.
2. **Actions must be valid**: action must be in the appliance's available_actions list. For `cycle` appliances output ONLY `run` or `idle`; never output `use` for a cycle appliance, and never output `run` for an on_demand appliance.
3. **Skip always_on devices**: do not generate decisions for always_on type appliances
4. **Decide for every time segment**: generate decisions for every time segment in the member's timeline
5. **Decide appliances by location**: decide the appliances of the specific room when in a room; decide personal appliances when out
6. Activity descriptions must be in English
7. Copy every input time, location, and activity value exactly and in the same order. Do not merge, split, add, remove, rename, or extend segments. Only add the operations array.
8. The member field must exactly equal "Member 1".
9. For room appliances, use only appliances belonging to that exact room. When Out, use only this member's personal appliances, or an actual ElectricVehicle if one is supplied.
10. An empty operations array is valid when the activity does not use electricity. Never invent an operation merely to make the list non-empty.
11. Never substitute aliases or synonyms: `computer` vs `laptop` and `tv` vs `television` are different strings. Only the exact unique_ids from the allowed list are valid; aliased ids will be discarded.
